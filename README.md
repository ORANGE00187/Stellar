Stellar is not just an AI assistant; it's an integrated development and research environment. Built with a powerful Python (Flask) backend and a dynamic frontend, Stellar leverages multiple large language models to provide a suite of specialized tools that go far beyond simple chat.

Core Features: The Five Modes of Creation

Stellar's power is divided into five distinct, high-level modes, each designed to solve complex, real-world problems.

üåå Stellar Mode

The foundational conversational AI experience. Perfect for quick questions, brainstorming, and general-purpose assistance.

Dynamic Model Selection: Switch between different AI models (Emerald, Lunarity, Crimson, Obsidian) to balance speed and reasoning power.

Full Chat History: All conversations are saved and searchable.

üî¨ Spectrum Mode: The AI Research Analyst

Transform a simple query into a comprehensive research paper.

Deep Web Research: Utilizes the Tavily API for its "Spectral Search" to gather real-time, relevant data.

Content Synthesis: Scrapes and analyzes web sources, integrating their content into a cohesive document.

Tangible Output: Generates detailed, well-structured research papers in Markdown and HTML, complete with citations and a novel solution proposal.

üöÄ Nebula Mode: The AI Application Architect

Build and design full-stack web applications from a single prompt.

4-Step Guided Process:

Plan: Generates a detailed blueprint for frontend and backend logic.

Frontend: Writes the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Backend: Produces the Python/Flask server code.

Verify: Performs a static analysis of the generated code to ensure cohesion and correctness.

Instant Deployment: The generated backend code is ready to run in the built-in sandbox.

üìä Cosmos Mode: The AI Data Artist

Turn raw data into beautiful, insightful, and interactive reports.

Data-Driven Visuals: Analyzes uploaded files (like CSVs) and web data to find key insights.

Stunning Reports: Generates single-page HTML reports using Tailwind CSS for styling and Chart.js for rich, interactive infographics.

üíª CodeLabs Mode: The AI Coding Dojo

An interactive environment for practicing and mastering coding skills.

Dynamic Problem Generation: The AI creates unique coding challenges on-demand based on topic and difficulty.

AI Mentor Panel: Provides Socratic hints, on-demand code reviews for correctness and efficiency, and explains complex concepts.

Integrated IDE Panel: Write your code in a live editor and run it against AI-generated test cases directly within the secure sandbox.

Interview Simulation: Engages with follow-up questions to test your understanding of time/space complexity and edge cases.

Key Platform Features

Secure Code Execution Sandbox: Run code in any supported language (Python, JS, C++, Java, etc.) in an isolated Docker environment. For web servers, it automatically uses ngrok to generate a live, shareable preview URL.

Advanced File Analysis: Upload and analyze a wide variety of file types (pdf, docx, images, code files). For large documents, Stellar intelligently splits them into chunks for complete analysis.

Full Chat & User Management:

Secure user authentication with hashed passwords.

Persistent, cloud-synced chat history via SQLite Cloud.

Powerful cross-chat search to find any message and jump directly to it.

Dynamic UI & Theming: The entire UI theme dynamically changes to match the aesthetic of the selected AI model.

üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your own instance of Stellar.

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

Docker and Docker Compose installed and running.

An ngrok authtoken for the live preview feature.

1. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stellar.git
cd Stellar
2. Set Up the Python Environment
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named .env in the project root and populate it with your API keys and secrets. Use the keys.env.example file as a template.

code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# Essential Keys
SECRET_KEY="a-very-strong-and-random-secret-key"
SQL_API_KEY="your_sqlite_cloud_api_key"
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN="your_ngrok_authtoken"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_super_secure_admin_password"

# Google AI API Keys (at least one is required)
PRIMARY_API_KEY="your_main_google_ai_api_key"
BACKUP_API_KEY_1="your_backup_google_ai_key_1"
# ... add more backup keys if needed

# Feature-Specific API Keys
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
# ... add keys for Nebula, Cosmos, etc.
NEBULA_KEY_STEP1="..."
4. Build the Docker Sandbox Images

The project includes a setup script to automatically build all the necessary Docker images for the CodeLabs and code execution features.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
python dockersetup.py

This script will create and build Dockerfiles for Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.

5. Run the Application
code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5013

You can now access Stellar in your browser at http://localhost:5013.
